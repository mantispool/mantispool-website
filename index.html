                <p class="pt-3">
                  Delegation is the process by which ada holders delegate the stake associated with their ada to a stake pool. It allows ada holders 
                  that do not have the skills or desire to run a node to participate in the network and be rewarded in proportion to the amount of stake 
                  delegated.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-3">
                  You maintain custody and control of your ada at all times. Stake pool operators never have access to your delegated ada. There are no 
                  lockup periods and you can transfer your ada at any time. Delegation is supported by <a href="https://daedaluswallet.io/" 
                  target="_blank">Daedalus</a> - a full-node wallet developed by IOHK - and <a href="https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/" 
                  target="_blank">Yoroi</a>: a browser-based wallet developed by EMURGO.
                </p>
                <p class="pt-3">
                  The procedures for delegation using each wallet is a little different but both allow you to search for the stake pool
                  using either a ticker symbol (eg. MANT), or via the Pool Id (the 56 alpha-numeric string). Once you have
                  delegated your ada, you can simply sit back and relax knowing that MANTIS is providing you with the best staking
                  experience and rewards.

                delegator reward dilution, we will continually add more pools to the MANTIS family whenever a pool reaches saturation levels.

                <p class="pt-3">Our dedicated patient engagement app and web portal allow you to access information instantaneously (no tedeous form, long calls, or administrative hassle) and securely</p>

                <p class="accordion">Q1. What is a stake pool?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Stake pools are run by stake pool operators. These are network participants with the skills to reliably ensure consistent uptime of a 
                  node, which is essential in ensuring the success of the Ouroboros protocol and the Cardano network as a whole.</p>

                  <p>The protocol uses a probabilistic mechanism to select a leader for each slot, who will be expected to create the next block in the 
                  chain. The chance of a stake pool node being selected as slot leader increases proportionately to the amount of stake delegated to that 
                  node. Each time a stake pool node is selected as a slot leader and successfully creates a block, it receives a reward, which is shared 
                  with the pool proportionate to the amount each member has delegated. Stake pool operators can deduct their running costs from the awarded 
                  ada, as well as specify a profit margin for providing the service.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="accordion">Q2. What is stake pool saturation?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Saturation is a term used to indicate that a particular stake pool has more stake delegated to it than is ideal for the network, and once
                  a pool reaches the point of saturation it will offer diminishing rewards. The saturation mechanism was designed to prevent centralization 
                  by encouraging delegators to delegate to different stake pools, and operators to set up alternative pools so that they can continue earning 
                  maximum rewards. Saturation, therefore, exists to preserve the interests of both ada holders delegating their stake and stake pool operators.</p>

                  <p>The goal is to avoid any single pool becoming too large – thereby disincentivizing delegation to other pools – and receiving a disproportionate 
                  amount of the rewards. The health of the network is partly determined by having a high number of active stake pools with a balanced amount of 
                  stake delegated to them. The more numerous and geographically diverse the network’s pools, the better.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="accordion">Q3. Why should I not select a 0% pool?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>It sounds tempting to go for the lowest possible fee, but just like very cheap items on eBay, it’s rarely worth it.</p>

                  <p>In order for a stake pool to generate the maximum rewards over time, you need a professional and sophisticated setup. You need to make 
                  sure that the pools are highly connected to the network, that the hardware is adequate, that the internet connection is optimal, that 
                  the software is configured correctly and that the pool software is updated frequently. You need to build redundancy and automation, to 
                  have multiple internet connections, to have UPS backup power for the hardware and protect against attacks. You need a high level of 
                  automation and monitoring, to always keep the pools running perfectly, and in case of any breakdown, have a backup server standing by, 
                  that will automatically take over.</p>
                  
                  <p>The income from a 0% pool is simply not enough to cover the expense of the above mentioned setup. For this reason, the 0% pools do not 
                  have this kind of setup, but instead run a much simpler operation. This means that they will perform worse over time, and hence pay less 
                  rewards. If you do the math, a 0% pool will give you worse rewards, even though it looks better on paper.</p>
                  
                  <p>You risk having the pool operator raise the fees after they’ve attracted enough stake, or having the pool simply shut down because it’s 
                  not profitable. You don’t want to constantly have to check if the pool is still at 0% fee and still running, and risk staking to a dead 
                  pool or suddenly paying a much higher fee.</p>
                  
                  <p>Pools with 0% fee are not incentivised to perform their best. The operator only makes money from the first block each epoch, and he then 
                  has no incentive to keep the pools performing well. There is no reason for him to make sure the rewards are at the absolute max, since 
                  it means extra costs for him, but no extra income. A pool with 1% fee has a great incentive to make sure the pools are always at their 
                  very max performance, and is willing to invest in it.</p>

                </div>
                
                <p class="accordion">Q4. Will the ADA rewards I earn be added to my delegated stake?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  Yes. Rewards earned accrue with your original stake. When rewards are received, the balance of your reward account increases – and, 
                  consequently, the delegated stake is increased. This all happens automatically so there is nothing manually that you need to do.
                </div>

                <p class="accordion">Q5. Which red flags should I look out for when loooking for a pool?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>There are many factors you should look out for, that indicates that a pool isn’t the best choice. Among these are:</p>

                  <p>-Pools with 0% fee (discussed in “Why should I not select a 0% pool” above)</p>
                  
                  <p>-Pools with pledge below 50k ADA (Signals that they might not be serious about their operation, or have confidence in themselves).</p>
                  
                  <p>-Pools that haven’t produced blocks yet (They might simply be new, but this can be a sign of bad performance).</p>
                  
                  <p>-Pools without a website or option to contact them (Signals they might not run a serious operation)</p>

                </div>
                
                <p class="accordion">Q6. How can I view my rewards earned each epoch from delegating?</p>
                <div class="panel">
                  <p>Yoroi wallet - Click on the "Receive" tab. In the left hand side panel, click on the "Reward" list item. In the center page grid
                    you will now see one or more addresses listed. Copy to the clipboard the address that begins with the word "stake". Go to the website
                    <a href="https://adaex.org" target="_blank">https://adaex.org</a> and in the search text box located at the top right corner of 
                    that website (the area that displays "Address, TX or whatever"), paste in the "stake" address that you previously saved and press 
                    the Enter key or click the search icon. The resulting page will show you the amount of ada earned from each epoch and pool that 
                    you have delegated to.
                  </p>

                  <p>Daedalus wallet - Click on the "Receive" tab. You will see a long list of addresses that are valid for your wallet. Click on any 
                     one of them. A dialog box will appear that shows a large QR code and underneath that code you will see the address that you
                     selected. Copy that address to the clipboard. Go to the website <a href="https://adaex.org" target="_blank">https://adaex.org</a> 
                     and in the search text box located at the top right corner of that website (the area that displays "Address, TX or whatever"), 
                     paste in the address that you previously saved and press the Enter key or click the search icon. On the resulting page, look 
                     about half way down and you will see a line that says "Stake Key" followed by an address that begins with the word "stake". 
                     Simply click on that "stake" address and the resulting page will show you the amount of ada earned from each epoch and pool that 
                     you have delegated to.
                  <p>
                                    
                    <p>AdaLite wallet - Click on the "Advanced" tab. You will see a list of various addresses. Under the heading "Reward address",
                      copy the address that begins with the word "stake" to the clipboard. 
                      Go to the website <a href="https://adaex.org" target="_blank">https://adaex.org</a> 
                      and in the search text box located at the top right corner of that website (the area that displays "Address, TX or whatever"), 
                      paste in the "stake" address that you previously saved and press the Enter key or click the search icon. The resulting page 
                      will show you the amount of ada earned from each epoch and pool that you have delegated to.
